This repository houses the most up to date build of NextStrain for SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the state of Maine and sequenced at the Jackson Laboratory in partnership with the Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory.

We have also provided all consensus sequences generated at Jackson Laboratory which includes those submitted to NCBI and GISAID plus sequences failing submition QC criteria at either database. We have filtered out consensus sequences with >20% missing calls (Ns).
